Contributing to the design of Language
======================================

Requirements
------------

There are no particular requirements to contribute to this project. However, a basic knowledge of linguistics, and a familiarity with the grammar of various human languages will help.

Advisory
--------

First and foremost, an intrinsic bias in Language's design is inevitable. Even if we turn our backs to one design, we will only end up facing another.

Instead, we should focus on what the goals are of the language, which is to create something extremely flexible and powerful, whatever that may entail.

I have one rule when it comes to contributors: Never assume any one method of language design is more natural than another.

The hardest part about designing a language, is trying to look past your own native tongue's bias. You will intrinsically feel that your language is the most logical and natural language there is -- and of course, you are wrong.

How you can help
----------------

There are a few steps that need to be [completed](https://github.com/drakovyrn/Language#status) before a 1.0.* release, but what's most important right now is designing a fully-functional, robust, and modular grammar system that will be the foundation of Language.

Other than assisting with the design of Language, help is also needed in the area of documentation, organization, and formatting. The documents containing all the rules for Language need to be laid out in a logical and precise manner that will make it simple for new learners to get started. In its current state, the (few) documents available are more like a collection of notes, rather than a manual that one could learn from. Many of the subjects within these documents will be expanded, and as such will need to be split into modular pieces that can be organized further into a directory.

Other than that, assistance with translations of existing material into other languages will need to be made so that Language can reach as many people around the world as possible.

Process
-------

When submitting a pull-request, all alterations will be reviewed before accepting. It is better to make small changes at a time, as large changes will take longer to review and are harder to manage as the possibility of error increases. Large pull requests also have the potential of being held back if portions of it are not accepted, even if the rest is acceptable.

In your pull request, make a precise description of what is being altered. Describe why you think this pull request will improve Language, as well as how it will help Language reach its goal of modularity, robustness, and usefulness. Be ready to discuss and back up your position and arguments, for if you do not convince the maintainer, then your pull request will simply be denied.

Bug Reporting
-------------

Language is not software, and as such does not have "bugs". However, that is not to say that there won't be problems with Language's design, mostly in the form of inconsistencies. If you find an issue with usability, create a bug report with an unambiguous title, a detailed description of what the issue or inconsistency is, and any potential solutions that you can think of. This will allow maintainers and contributors to have an open discussion, and will be the easiest method of collaboration when it comes to solving problems and reaching project goals.
